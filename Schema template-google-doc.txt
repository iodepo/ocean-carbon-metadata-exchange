[a]The service provider, service operator, or service performer; the goods producer. Another party (a seller) may offer those services or goods on behalf of the provider. A provider may also serve as the seller.
[b]Ideally we want to have PID and additional text
[c]Ideally, you wouldn't have to next this information in the Dataset record, but just link out to JSON doc with an "@id" property that contains it, like an OceanExpert page for people or an EDMO page with embedded JSON-LD/schema.org for organisations


Some ODIS users still prefer to embed it, however, as they're not totally confident in the link to the other resource remaining valid in the long-term
[d]I think there are sort of two perspectives here.  The discovery perspective and the use.perspective.  In discovery, you can have a system that will resolve those links and show you the information.  But when a user downloads data, they are going to want to have all the metadata with the data (preferably embedded in the data in a way that is machine actionable), rather than having to go out and chase down links to get all the metadata details.
[e]Keep in mind this is the id/url to the JSON-LD file (or RDF) that contains the metadata in this object.
[f]It can be the same as the "identifier" property value, as long as the landing page has JSON-LD embedded in it.
[g]The identifier of the Thing
[h]jsonLD, machine readable version of the Thing
[i]See https://book.odis.org/thematics/depth/index.html
[j]I would have a list of services provided by an org as separate. 


These types are too different to be applied to the same thing
[k]Identify a vocabulary for categories
[l]Theres's this: https://skos.um.es/unesco6/
